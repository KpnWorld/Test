## 📌 File Structure Philosophy

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each cog handles a single category of functionality.  
- **Modular Design:** Utilities are reusable across multiple cogs.  
- **Scalable Layout:** New features get their own cog and database methods.  
- **Clear Documentation:** All major files and folders are listed in `docs/`.
